## Dataset Overview:
Utilizing the Ergast API and FastF1 Python Package, our research analyzes Formula 1 data from 1951 to 2023, detailing races, competition results, participant info, and performance metrics like lap times and pit stops. The dataset covers race specifics, circuit details, and historical evolution, reflecting track changes and safety standards. It also includes comprehensive information on constructors, team performance, driver careers, and performance metrics crucial for understanding race strategies and driver skills in Formula 1.

## Technologies and Libraries used:
Programming Language - Python <br>
pandas : For Data manipulation and analysis <br>
matplotlib : Plotting library for creating visualizations <br>
seaborn : Data visualization library based on matplotlib, for statistical graphics <br>
csv : Module providing classes for reading and writing CSV files<br>
scikit-learn : Python library, providing an array of machine learning algorithms and utilities for streamlined model development, assessment, and implementation <br>

## Feature Engineering and Exploratory Data Analysis:
The report underwent rigorous data preparation steps, including removal of missing values, non-finish instances, outliers, and redundant data, ensuring a clean and reliable dataset. Analysis focused on the 2016-2023 timeframe, merging datasets for comprehensive driver insights while employing exploratory data analysis (EDA) tools like bar charts and correlation matrices. Visualizations highlighted dominant racing teams, key tracks, and experienced drivers, with the correlation matrix revealing valuable variable relationships. While correlation aids understanding, caution was emphasized regarding inferring causation. Overall, EDA provided rich insights for stakeholders in Formula 1, aiding strategies, predictions, and a deeper appreciation of the sport's nuances.
